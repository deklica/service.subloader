0.1.8	(24.05.2024)
- Cosmetic changes and some small fixes

Only supported by OpenSubtitles Plus (OpenSubtitles.com) and OpenSubtitles.org by OpenSubtitles with dual subs addon. If you have Subtitles Dialog - Contextmenu (context.subtitlesdialog.contextmenu) addon by burekas installed, remove it.

- G-Mod changes removed
