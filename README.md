# Sub Loader


> ### About Sub Loader

Sub Loader allow you to automatically load subtitles for your content.
It uses OpenSubtitles.org as subtitles source.
There are custom settings to trigger the service.


> ### Issues

Currently the addon is in Alpha stage, there are some bugs and a lot of features to add.
The subloader will not download any subtitles if your content don't provide a valid IMDBNumber.
So, most likly your episodes will not have IMDBNumber because Kodi scrapper do not provide it at episode level.
For the 3 party addons it will work if there is an IMDBNumber and the file name with the media quality. 
It will be added in future an auto query search by name if no IMDBNumber was found.

> ### Development

Sub Loader is a fork from the well known autosubs addon, all credits to the original developers.
It also contains some code from an jen base addon, all credits to the original developers.
I'm not a programmer, all i do is try and error to find a possible solution, so please if some one want's to help pushing this addon forward, be my guest.
