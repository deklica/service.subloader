# Sub Loader


> ### About Sub Loader

Sub Loader allow you to automatically load subtitles for your content.
It uses OpenSubtitles.org as subtitles source.
There are custom settings to trigger the service.


> ### Issues

Currently the addon is in Alpha stage, there are some bugs and a lot of features to add.
If you use this addon and have installed the addon "service.autosubs" please disable it, otherwise the subloader will not perform properly.
The subloader need an valid IMDBNumber and the file name with the media quality to work properly, if your content don't provide a valid IMDBNumber the addon will try by query search. This type of search take some time to complete, in most cases at least 10 seconds.
So, most likly your episodes will not have IMDBNumber because Kodi scrapper do not provide it at episode level.
For now the addon is only compatible with Kodi 18.0 or higher.

> ### Development

Sub Loader is a fork from the well known autosubs addon, all credits to the original developers.
It also contains some code from an jen base addon, all credits to the original developers.
I'm not a programmer, all i do is try and error to find a possible solution, so please if some one want's to help pushing this addon forward, be my guest.
