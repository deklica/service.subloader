# SubLoader

> ### About SubLoader
SubLoader auto trigger Kodi subtitle search dialog if no subtitle (language) with exclusions is found, or auto download the best subtitle automatically from OpenSubtitles.org as soon you start the video for a Movie/TV Show, or reads the embedded subtitle if it is in the excluded list.
It also has a feature to add a subtitles dialog contextmenu button to search if subtitle is available for a video.

Special thanks to [OpenSubtitles.org](http://www.opensubtitles.org ) for providing a unique UA for Subloader.

> ### Issues
The addon is currently in Alpha stage. There are some bugs and several features to be added.

If you use this addon and have installed the addon "service.autosubs" or "service.autoSRT" please disable it; otherwise, the subloader won't function correctly.

The subloader needs a valid IMDBNumber, and the filename must include the media quality to work correctly. If your content doesn't provide a valid IMDBNumber, the addon tries to do a query search. This search typically takes at least 10 seconds to complete.

Most likely your episodes won't have an IMDBNumber because Kodi scrapper does not provide it at an episode level.

For now, the addon is only compatible with Kodi 18.0 or higher.

> ### Development
SubLoader is a fork from the well-known AutoSubs/AutoSrt addon. It also contains some code from a Jen base addon. All credits go to the original developers and DenimNani for original SubLoader.

I'm not a programmer; all I do is trial and error to find a possible solution. So please if someone wants to help out and to push this addon forward, be my guest.
